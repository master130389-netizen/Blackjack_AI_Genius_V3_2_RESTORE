VOICE INTEGRATION (ITA)
-----------------------
Opzioni per ottenere voce Alexa-like "Ava":

1) Android built-in TTS:
   - Alcuni dispositivi Android offrono voci di alta qualità. Su molti dispositivi puoi selezionare Google 'WaveNet' voices or OEM voices from Settings -> Accessibility -> Text-to-speech.
   - In Kivy (on Android), use pyjnius to call android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech and set Locale and voice name.

2) Google Cloud Text-to-Speech (WaveNet):
   - Produces high-quality natural voices (paid).
   - Steps: create Google Cloud project, enable TTS API, create service account, call TTS API server-side or client-side to synthesize audio.
   - We recommend server-side TTS for Premium users: generate short mp3 files and serve them via the server when a Premium suggestion is given.

3) Pre-recorded voice files:
   - Alternatively record a set of prompts for common suggestions (Stand, Hit, Double, Split) using a voice actor.
   - Place files in app/tts_samples and play them on Premium suggestions.

This package includes demo placeholders in /tts_samples.
